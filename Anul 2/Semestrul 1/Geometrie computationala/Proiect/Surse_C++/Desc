--------------------  C++ implementation of Graham Scan algorithm ( without sort ) ----------------------------------------

This is the c++ implementation of the algorithm to find the convex hull of a polygon given as input. The input is like this:

    -   The number of points;
    -   The points given by their (x, y) coordinates. ( !!! the points need to be given in counter-clockwise direction ).
    
After reading the input, the program adds to the convex hull the first two points and then iterates through the rest. At each
step, we check (by applying the orientation test) where the point to be added is situated in comparison to the segment formed by 
the last two points of the hull, like this:

    -   On the left side =>   we just add the point to the hull;
    -   On the right side =>  we add the point to the hull, replacing the last point of the hull;
    -   On the same segment (colinearity) =>  we only keep the segment heads in the hull.
    
After iterating through the points, we need to treat one case separately: the last point and the first two points of the hull. 
We check the orientation and if the first point of the hull is on the right side or colinear, we remove it from the hull.

This project was created as an assignment at university.
